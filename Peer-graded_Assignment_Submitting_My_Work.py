Exercise 6 - Create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools.


# ## Data Science Tools
# 
# | Tool           | Description                                         |
# |----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
# | Jupyter Notebook | Interactive coding environment                     |
# | Anaconda       | Distribution of Python and R for data science       |
# | RStudio        | Integrated development environment for R           |
# | Tableau        | Data visualization and business intelligence       |
# | Apache Spark   | Distributed computing framework for big data       |
# | Hadoop         | Distributed storage and processing of big data     |
# | Docker         | Containerization platform for deploying applications |
# | Git            | Version control system for code collaboration      |
# 
# These tools play a crucial role in various stages of the data science workflow, including data exploration, analysis, visualization, and collaboration. Depending on your specific needs and preferences

Exercise 7 - Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples.


# # Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[1]:


# Arithmetic operations
code = compile("5 + 4", "<string>", "eval")
eval(code)
# Result: 9


# In[2]:


code1 = compile("(5 + 7) * 2", "<string>", "eval")
eval(code1)
# Result: 24


# In[3]:


import math
# Volume of a sphere
code2 = compile("4 / 3 * math.pi * math.pow(25, 3)", "<string>", "eval")
eval(code2)
# Result: 65449.84694978735


# In[ ]:


Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers.


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

# In[4]:


(3*4)+5
# Result: 17


# In[ ]:


Exercise 9 - Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours.


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

# In[5]:


days = 0
hours = 0
mins = 0

time = 200
#days = time / 1440
leftover_minutes = time % 1440
hours = leftover_minutes / 60
#mins = time - (days*1440) - (hours*60)
print(str(days) + " days, " + str(hours) + " hours, " + str(mins) +  " mins. ")

# Result: 3.3333333333333335 hours

Exercise 10 -Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives.


# Below the introduction cell created in Exercise 3, insert a new markdown cell to list the objectives that this notebook covered (i.e. some of the key takeaways from the course). In this new cell start with an introductory line titled: Objectives: in bold font. Then using an unordered list (bullets) indicate 3 to 5 items covered in this notebook, such as List popular languages for Data Science.
